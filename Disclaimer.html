                  of its lawyers creates an attorney-client relationship between you and the Firm. You will become a client of the Firm only if and when you sign an engagement agreement setting forth the scope of the Firm’s engagement, the fee arrangement,
                  and other relevant matters. As a matter of policy, the Firm does not accept a new client without first investigating for possible conflicts of interests and obtaining a signed engagement letter. (The Firm may, for example, already represent
                  another party involved in your matter.)

              <p><b>No Guarantee of Results.</b> Some of the case summaries, reports of past results and individual lawyer biographies on this website may describe past matters handled for clients of the Firm. These descriptions are meant only to provide information
